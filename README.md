# Capture: Receipt
We'll cover your OCR costs by monetizing aggregate, de-identified data from your receipts.
Upload receipts; retrieve results. Under the covers it's [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) with a simple client-friendly API.

## How to Use
First, you'll need to [ask for access](https://rxsny9wwvhn.typeform.com/to/N7LTj5eN?typeform-source=mytiki.com). 

Once approved, we recommend using one of our [Client Libraries](https://github.com/mytiki/client-library) to upload receipts and retrieve results. But if you'd like to use the REST API directly, visit the [API Reference](https://docs.mytiki.com/reference/rest-api-upload-receipt).
